# Flappy Bird Game (Demo)

This is a demo version of the **Flappy Bird** game, created as a practice project for developing 2D games with Unity.

## What is Flappy Bird?  
Flappy Bird is a simple yet challenging 2D arcade-style game. The player controls a bird that must avoid obstacles by jumping through narrow gaps. To make the bird jump, you can either:  
- Press the **space bar**  
- Click the **left mouse button**

While it may seem like a basic game, its design and mechanics make it an excellent starting point for learning 2D game development.

## Purpose  
This project was developed as part of my learning process to explore Unity and enhance my game development skills.

> **Note:** This is just a demo and may not include all the features of the original Flappy Bird.
